# WorkTimeSplitGrid

A React-based Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) **dataset** control for the
**Rounded Time Entries** table (Schulz Systemtechnik). It replaces a Canvas
Custom Page with an in-grid master/detail workflow: pick a rounded time entry,
distribute its total duration across the work subtypes
(**Normal / Überstunden / Nacht-Sonntag / Feiertag**), and save — the control
creates the split records, marks the original and its pauses as completed, and
deletes the original.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core functionality
- **Master list** of Rounded Time Entries with a live search box. Each card
  shows the composed title, a label-less chip row (**resource → project**), and
  the total duration. The resource is `sst_resource_ref.name` (falling back to
  the `sst_resource` text field); the project chip is the project number
  (`sst_project_id.sst_projectnumber`).
- **Composed entry title** (list + detail): `<type> am <date>` (e.g. *Arbeit am
  07.08.2024*). The date and the related project number
  (`sst_project_id.sst_projectnumber`) are fetched per page via one WebAPI
  `$expand` call, so the title and the project chip work even when those columns
  aren't in the bound view. Missing parts are omitted gracefully.
- **Two modes** (toolbar toggle). Both require the entry to have a **project**
  (`sst_project_id` set):
  - **Aufteilen / Split** — `sst_worksubtypecompleted = No`; opens the split
    editor on the right.
  - **Zuordnen / Assign** — `sst_worksubtypecompleted = Yes` **and**
    `sst_timereport` empty; a multi-select list with a **Create delivery notes**
    action.
  Breaks (`sst_type` = `pauseValue`, default `Pause`) are excluded from both
  modes, as are entries on **fixed-price ("Festpreis") projects** (the project's
  `hso_projecttype = 100000001`, filtered via the `sst_Project_id` navigation
  property). The list is loaded **directly from the server with the mode filter
  already applied** (`webApi.retrieveMultipleRecords` on
  `sst_roundedtimeentries`), rather than pulling every page of the bound view and
  filtering client-side.
  This keeps the filters correct and the control fast even when the table holds
  far more than Dataverse's 5000-record page cap (the previous approach showed an
  empty list once the table exceeded that cap).
- **Create delivery notes** (assign mode) — tick one or more entries; a bottom
  action bar shows the count and **two** buttons:
  - **Create delivery notes** — creates the notes and stays in the list (if
    exactly one note results it still opens automatically).
  - **Create & open ↗** — does the same, then opens the result: a single
    delivery note opens directly; if **several** were created, a picker overlay
    lists them by **delivery-note number** (`sst_deliverynotenumberassembly_str`,
    with the work order as a sub-line) so the user chooses which to open.
  Both create one delivery note (`sst_timereports`) per work order across the
  selection and link each selected entry to its work order's note via
  `sst_TimeReport`. Entries already assigned to a delivery note are rejected.
  While the notes are being created a **progress overlay** blocks the list so
  the user can't keep clicking. (Ported from the Schulz `createTimeReport`
  ribbon command.)
- **Live search** across the title, type, date, **project number**, and
  **resource name** (`sst_resource_ref.name`) — over the full server-filtered
  result set (not just one page).
- **Period filter & sorting** — a period filter (**All / Today / This week /
  This month**, by `sst_date`) sits in a sub-toolbar; sorting (**date
  newest/oldest, project, resource, duration**) is a compact **sort icon** in the
  top row next to the search box, opening a custom, dependency-free dropdown
  (click-outside / Escape close, keyboard navigation). Both apply client-side
  over the loaded set, so they're instant. The command bar shows **no record
  count** (it caused a layout shift on filter changes and isn't needed).
- **Search-match highlight** — matching substrings are highlighted in the card
  title and chips as you type.
- **Pull-to-refresh (mobile)** — on a phone, pull the list down past the
  threshold to reload from the server (a damped pull indicator + spinner).
- **Empty state** — when no entries qualify (or a search has no matches) the list
  shows a binoculars icon and a short one-liner instead of a blank pane.
- **Scope switch** (*My hours ↔ All hours*, defaults to **My hours**) — a compact
  toggle: **off = my hours**, **on = all hours**. My-hours filters to entries
  whose resource's user is the current user — the user's `bookableresource`(s)
  are resolved via `_userid_value`, and the list query is restricted to those via
  `_sst_resource_ref_value` (a server-side filter). The switch is **locked off**
  (my hours) for everyone except holders of **System Administrator** or **SST |
  Dispo Teamleitung Addon**, who may turn it on to see all hours.
- **Detail split panel** — selecting an entry loads its work-subtype rows
  (`sst_roundedtimeentryworksubtypes`) and lets the user edit the hours per
  subtype, with a live **Total / Distributed / Remaining** summary. The detail
  header is shortened to **project number / booking number** (e.g.
  `P10006786 / S-120044`) — the type and date are already on the sub-line. The
  booking number is the `bookableresourcebooking` display value.
- **Smart pre-fill (★ button)** — a small star/AI button in the panel head fills
  the distribution from the entry's **date + total duration** (on demand; the
  user can still adjust). **Hidden by default** — enable it with the
  `showSuggestButton` manifest property (set it to `show`). Rules:
  - **Holiday** → all on *Feiertag*.
  - **Sunday** → all on *Nacht / Sonntag*.
  - **Workday ≤ 8 h** → all on *Normal*; **> 8 h** → 8 h on *Normal*, the rest on
    *Überstunde*.
  Holidays are resolved live via the chain **entry → `sst_resource_ref`
  (bookableresource) → `sst_site_ref` (sst_site) → `sst_country_ref`
  (sst_country)**, then `sst_publicholiday` rows for that country whose
  `[sst_startdate_dat, sst_enddate_dat]` range covers the date. Best-effort: if a
  link is missing or unreadable, the day is treated as a normal workday. Subtype
  rows are matched by keyword (robust to Überstunde/Überstunden).
- **"Use remaining" icon** — while time is still unallocated (remaining > 0), a
  small arrow icon appears next to **every** subtype field; clicking it adds the
  remaining amount to that field's current value (one tap to finish the split).
- **Guarded save** — the *Save split* button only enables when the distributed
  hours equal the entry's total duration.
- **Atomic split workflow** (faithful to the original Custom Page). It first
  *prepares* everything read-only (reads the original, resolves the work type
  from the composite **(paytype, timetype)** key, resolves the lookup
  `@odata.bind` targets, builds the per-subtype create payloads and finds the
  related pauses), then performs all mutations **transactionally**:
  - creates one Rounded Time Entry per subtype with hours > 0 (copying the
    booking / work order / project lookups, date, name, notes; subtype name into
    `sst_workordersubtype`; type `<Type> (<Subtype>)`; `sst_worksubtypecompleted
    = Yes`; the resolved `sst_worktype_ref` / `sst_worktype_title_str`),
  - marks the original **and its related pauses** completed,
  - deletes the original (child subtype rows cascade).
  These run as a **single `$batch` changeset** (all-or-nothing) posted to the
  Web API `$batch` endpoint. If that endpoint isn't reachable/authorized in the
  host, it falls back to a **compensating sequence** over `context.webAPI` that
  rolls the created splits back (and un-marks the original) if the delete fails —
  so a split never leaves duplicates or an orphaned original.
- **Confirmation dialog** before the destructive save/delete.

### 📱 Adaptive (desktop + mobile)
- **One control, three layouts**, chosen at runtime from
  `context.client.getFormFactor()` (with an allocated-width fallback) and the
  live container size:
  - **Desktop / Tablet** → the two-pane master/detail layout (unchanged).
  - **Phone (portrait)** → a single-pane, touch-first flow: full-width list →
    tap an entry → full-screen split editor with a **‹ Back** header → save
    returns to the list. Larger tap targets, big numeric inputs, and a
    bottom-pinned save button. Each subtype row is a single compact line —
    **label + a +/− stepper + a narrow number field** (±0.25 h, floored at 0) —
    so all subtypes are visible at a glance; tap the steppers or type directly.
  - **Phone (landscape)** → the two-pane **cockpit**: list + split editor side
    by side under a compact, single-row command bar — the wide-but-short
    viewport is no longer wasted by stacked toolbars over a hidden list. Keeps
    the phone touch ergonomics (pull-to-refresh, big steppers); no **‹ Back**
    needed since both panes are visible. Rotating the device switches between
    portrait single-pane and landscape cockpit live (driven by the allocated
    width/height; needs ≥ 640px width, so small phones stay single-pane).
- **Collapsible filter bar (phone)** — the search + mode + period + sort bar
  collapses (animated) to a **one-line summary** (`🔍 Zuordnen · Alle · Datum
  (newest) ⌄`) via a *"Hide filters"* trigger, maximizing the visible list;
  tap the summary to expand it again. The summary reflects the active filters
  live and shows a search-active dot. Desktop is unaffected (bar always full).
  Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Assign the same control to **Web + Tablet + Phone** when adding it to the
  view; no separate mobile build to maintain.

### 🌐 Internationalization
- **Trilingual UI** (German / English / French), chosen automatically from the
  user's Dataverse language (`context.userSettings.languageId`).

### 📴 Offline (blocked — connection required)
- **Online** → the live server-side queries + `$batch` save (as above).
- **Offline** → the control **blocks** with a clear *"Connection required"* state
  and a **Retry** button — it does **not** show a cached list. Rationale: this
  control needs the live Web API for **both** the mode-filtered list **and** the
  transactional split/assign save, so an offline read-only cache could only ever
  show **stale, wrong-status rows** (e.g. an already-split entry showing under
  *Split*). Blocking is honest and avoids that confusion.
- It does **not** blindly trust `isOffline()` (which can falsely report offline on
  a cold start): it **probes the live Web API** and shows the blocking state if
  that call **fails** (bounded by a ~7 s timeout) **or returns empty while the host
  hints offline** — because in offline mode the Web API returns an *empty result as
  a success*, which must not be mistaken for "online with no entries". It only goes
  online if the server actually returns rows (or the host doesn't hint offline).
  While the probe runs it shows a neutral **"Connecting…"** state; on success it
  goes straight to the normal online list/editor — no manual offline→online toggle
  needed. **Retry** re-runs the probe, so a device that just reconnected recovers
  with one tap.
  - *Trade-off:* a user who is genuinely online **with zero entries** while
    `isOffline()` still (falsely) reports offline is also shown the block — rare,
    and the admin fix below removes it entirely.
- `WebAPI`/`Utility` are declared **`required="false"`** so the host still renders
  the control (and thus the "connection required" state) instead of failing with a
  generic "control can't load" error.
- **Recommended:** since the control can't work offline anyway, exclude this app /
  the `sst_roundedtimeentries` table from the **mobile offline profile** (or turn
  off offline for the app) so it always runs online. Full **write-enabled** offline
  (Option C) is deferred — see [`OfflinePlan.md`](OfflinePlan.md).

### 🔧 Technical
- **React 17** + TypeScript, no extra runtime libraries.
- **Telemetry / logging**: a small structured logger (`telemetry.ts`) writes to
  the PCF diagnostic trace (`context.tracing`) and the console, both guarded so
  logging can never break the control. The destructive operations are
  instrumented as timed operations with progress steps and a **stage marker** —
  e.g. the split save logs `splitSave.start` → `splitSave.splitsCreated` →
  `splitSave.pausesCompleted` → `splitSave.ok` (or `splitSave.fail` with the
  stage it reached, so a failure between *splitsCreated* and *deleteOriginal* is
  diagnosable). Delivery-note creation logs `createReports.*` (per-note + result)
  and load failures log `loadEntries`.
- **Schema-aware, configurable**: all field bindings have verified SST defaults
  in `schema.ts` and can be overridden per placement via manifest properties.
- **Lookup-safe split create**: `@odata.bind` targets are resolved at runtime
  from the original record's lookup annotations + entity metadata, so the work
  order / booking / project links survive the split regardless of their target
  tables.
- **Optimistic list updates**: after a split-save or delivery-note assignment the
  affected rows leave the current filter, so they're dropped from the list locally
  (the split original and the assigned entries) instead of triggering a full
  server reload — instant, no flicker. A mode switch or "My hours" toggle reloads
  fresh from the server. `createTimeReports` returns the actually-assigned ids so
  only those are removed (partial failures keep their rows).

## ⚙️ Properties

The control binds a dataset (`entries`) to a Rounded Time Entries view. Only
two properties are exposed in the maker:

| Property            | Default                      | Purpose |
|---------------------|------------------------------|---------|
| `entries` (dataset) | —                            | The Rounded Time Entries shown as the master list |
| `showSuggestButton` | *(empty = hidden)*           | Set to `show` (or true/yes/ja/1) to display the AI suggestion (★) button in the split detail |

The field-mapping overrides (`totalField` `sst_duration`, `dateField`
`sst_date`, `typeField` `sst_type`, `pauseValue` `Pause`, `completedField`
`sst_worksubtypecompleted`, `subtypeField` `sst_workordersubtype`) are
**disabled** — the SST defaults in `schema.ts` apply, so they no longer clutter
the maker UI. To re-expose any one, uncomment the matching `<property>` in
`ControlManifest.Input.xml` and its read in `index.ts`.

Fixed schema (in `schema.ts`): parent `sst_roundedtimeentries`, child
`sst_roundedtimeentryworksubtypes` (`sst_name`, `sst_timevalue`,
`sst_roundedtimeentry`), copied lookups `sst_workorder` / `sst_bookableresourcebooking`
/ `sst_project_id`, notes `sst_freitextfeld`.

## 🛠️ Build

```powershell
npm install
npm run build -- --buildMode production
```

To produce importable solution zips, run the solution
[`build.ps1`](../WorkTimeSplitGrid.Solution/build.ps1).

## 📝 Notes / assumptions
- The work-subtype rows are expected to exist per entry (created upstream); the
  control edits their values and writes the split records.
- "Total duration" is read from `sst_duration`. If your environment uses a
  different total column, re-enable the `totalField` override (see Properties).
- Verified against the SSTCore solution export; sanity-check field names against
  the target environment before enabling the destructive save in production.
